      <description>Yelp is an online platform where users can rate and write reviews on local businesses. Users can also browse the website to search for local businesses of their interest.
To facilitate users&amp;rsquo; browsing on Yelpâ€™s website, this project aims to make customized recommendations on local businesses to every user.

      <description>Quora is a social question-and-answer website based in Mountain View, California, where users can collaborate by editing questions and commenting on answers that have been submitted by other users.
While the convenience that anyone can post and edit questions on the forum allows users to dynamically engage in the service, the downside is that some users may post insincere questions which would compromise the reliability of the website and/or degrade other groups of individuals.</description>

      <description>My name is Daniel Han and I live in Toronto, Ontario. I was a full-blown building guy until I recently decided to become a data guy instead.
As a former forensic engineer, I observed failed structures and identified the series of events leading up to the failure.
I have always been exceptional at building stories from observations and passionate in making sense out of visual evidences.
Through the BrainStation Data Science Diploma program, I have gained the knowledge and skills to use this ability for drawing valuable business insights from data for a more informed decision, and to automate the process of the decision making using various AI techniques.</description>
