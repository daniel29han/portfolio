    "## 2. Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "While the process of analysis and modelling were iterative, the following general procedure was taken throughout:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data Acquisition:** Several datasets available in json file format are downloaded from the Yelp website, upon which insights are drawn and models trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Transformation & Cleaning:** The obtained raw datasets are converted to a comma-separated values (csv) format, combined, and transformed into a wrangled dataset prepared for  analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The general attributes of businesses and consumer info associated with high ratings are reviewed. Additional variables are created through feature engineering. Some of the findings are illustrated. \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Baseline Recommenders:** Three baseline recommenders are created: 1) content-based filtering, 2) user-based collaborative filtering, and 3) collaborative filtering with matrix-factorization. 50 recommendations from each recommender are are reviewed and compared against each other. While the content-based filtering takes into account the attributes and categories of every business, collaborative filtering only uses the rating from every available reviewer-business pair to make the recommendations.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Neural Network:** A neural network model trained on all the business and user data is used to find the mathematical relationship between the rating and features of businesses and user profiles, taking the regression approach. Using this relationship, the rating of every user-business pair is predicted and the top 50 businesses are recommended for a given user.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Final Model Selection & Optimization:**  All the constructed recommenders are compared against each other and the model with the highest score for a given metric is selected as the final model. Subsequently, the final model is optimized to provide the best results (i.e., most relevant recommendations)."

    "## 3. Limitations and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- As previously noted, this project was conducted without the knowledge of the accuracy/relevance metrics of the existing recommendation algorithm in place. Any accuracy/relevance metrics are advised to be compared between the existing and this proposed algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- When combining the existing star ratings with the sentiment scores to create a continuous scale from 0 to 5, 70% of the new rating was taken from the star ratings and the remaining 30% from the sentiment secores. While the reasoning behind is that the star rating would still be the better indication of one's experience with the business, it is to be noted that a bias has been introduced while deciding the relative proportion to be 7:3 and shall be modified as required in the later process to better reflect the true customer satisfication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business attributes and categories containing more than 75% of unknown values were deemed not indicative of the business rating, therefore were dropped.  \n",

    "Other limitations and assumptions are discussed throughout the analysis."
