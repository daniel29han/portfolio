# Welcome to my `portfolio`. I'm Daniel!

## About Me
My name is Daniel Han and I was a forensic engineer until just a few months ago. With my structural engineering background, I investigated many buildings for insurance claims for the adjustors to make informed decisions on the coverage amounts or whether a claim is fraudulent.

Now, I am an aspiring Data Scientist enrolled in a Bootcamp at [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp) to embark on a new journey in my career. Excited about all the things I can do with what I've learned, I have already started a few projects which I decided to showcase here.    

## About This Portfolio
This portfolio contains the projects I have completed so far and will continuously work on for the next few months. As I am yet halfway through my program, these projects do not yet encompass the entire aspects of a Data Science/Analysis project. As the course progresses, I will be actively adding to and modifying these projects. That means, everytime you visit here, you will find a newer, better version of my projects!

My program ends this December and by then I will be equipped with all the necessary knowledge, skills and techniques that a great Data Scientist must have. In the meantime, please check out my projects and feel free to connect with me on Linkedin or via email!

## [Project 1 - Yelp Rating Prediction and Recommender System](https://github.com/daniel29han/portfolio/tree/main/Projects/Yelp)
<sub>**Data Acquisition | Data Cleaning | Regular Expressions | Visualizations | Python | EDA | Time Series | Machine Learning | Regression | Git**</sub>
<br>
#### Overview
- A hypothetical project where, given the user information and local business, the user's rating on the business is predicted on a continuous scale between 0 and 5.
- The original data is provided in JSON format and requires somewhat extensive cleaning using regular expressions (RegEx).
- Multiple schemas - business, user, review, 
- A recommender system will be created so that users with similar preferences are grouped and recommended local businesses accordingly.
