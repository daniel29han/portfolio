# `Welcome to my portfolio`!

## About Me
My name is Daniel Han and I was a forensic engineer until just a few months ago. With my structural engineering background, I investigated many buildings for insurance claims for the adjustors to make informed decisions on the coverage amounts or whether a claim is fraudulent.

Now, I am an aspiring Data Scientist enrolled in a Bootcamp at [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp) to embark on a new journey in my career. Excited about all the things I can do with what I've learned, I have already started a few projects which I decided to showcase here.    

## About This Portfolio
This portfolio contains the projects I have completed so far and will continuously work on for the next few months. As I am yet halfway through my program, these projects do not yet encompass the entire aspects of a Data Science/Analysis project. As the course progresses, I will be actively adding to and modifying these projects. That means, everytime you visit here, you will find a newer, better version of my projects!

My program ends this December and by then I will be equipped with all the necessary knowledge, skills and techniques that a great Data Scientist must have. In the meantime, please check out my projects and feel free to connect with me on Linkedin or via email!

### `Overview`
- Yelp is an online platform where users can rate and write reviews on local businesses. Users can also browse the website and/or search local businesses of their interest.<br><br>
- To facilitate the user's browsing on Yelp's website, it has been decided to make customized recommendations on local businesses to each user by predicting how much they will be satisfied with the businesses.<br><br>
- In this hypothetical project, upwards of 6 million consumer reviews on Yelp are analyzed to study the attributes of successful local businesses and understand the consumer preferences.<br><br>
- Also, given the user information and local business, the user's rating on the business is predicted on a continuous scale between 0 and 5.<br><br>
- Finally, a recommender system will be created so that users with similar preferences are grouped and recommended local businesses accordingly.


### Data Cleaning
- A hypothetical project where, 
- The original data is provided in JSON format and requires somewhat extensive cleaning using regular expressions (regex).
- Multiple schemas - business, user, review, check-ins - are cleaned, reformatted and combined into one.
