# Welcome to My Portfolio. I'm Daniel!

## About Me
My name is Daniel, who was a forensic engineer until a couple months ago. Now I am an aspiring Data Scientist in a Bootcamp at [BrainStation](https://brainstation.io/course/online/remote-data-science-bootcamp) to embark on a new journey in my career.

## About This Portfolio
This portfolio contains the projects I have completed so far and will continuously working on for the next few months. As I am currently 4 months into my program ending in December, these projects do not yet encompass the entire aspects of a Data Science/Analysis project. As the course progresses, I will keep adding to these projects actively in the Agile manner. That means, everytime you visit this repository, you will find a newer, better version of my projects!

As mentioned earlier, my program ends this December and by then I will be equipped with all the necessary knowledge, skills and techniques that a great Data Scientist must have. In the meantime, please check out my projects and feel free to connect with me on Linkedin or via email!
